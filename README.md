## Stay organized, stay ahead!

With an intuitive and user-friendly command-line interface (CLI), our Go-based Kanban board allows you to track tasks, allocate resources, and visualize your progress effectively. Following best development practices, the project is built upon the Go ecosystem, with libraries like Cobra, Bubbletea, and Lipgloss to facilitate user interaction.
